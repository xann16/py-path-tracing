# py-path-tracing
Implementation of simple path tracing renderer using three programming paradigms (object-oriented, functional, data-driven) in Python. Inspired by similar talk by Matt Godbolt at CppCon 2019 (in C++).

NOTE: Current version includes only object-oriented implementation, which due to Python's various overheads has tragic performance.
